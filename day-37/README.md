# interfaces

* Go interface type defines the behavior of other types by specifying a set
of methods that need to be implemented
* interfaces are abstract types
* define a set of functions that need to be
implemented so that a type can be considered an instance of the interface.
* interface is a set of methods and a type, and it is used to define the behavior of other types.
* The biggest advantage you get from having and using an interface is that you can pass a
variable of a type that implements that particular interface to any function that expects a
parameter of that specific interface.
* interfaces should be utilized when there is a need for
making sure that certain conditions will be met and certain behaviors will
be anticipated from a Go element.
