/*
 constants are variables that cannot change their values.
 constants are defined with the help of the const keyword.
 the value of a constant variable is defined at compile time not at run time.
NOTE:-GO is a statically typed language.
Go doesnâ€™t provide implicit type conversions and it requires us to do explicit type casting
 whenever we mix variables of multiple types in an operation.
