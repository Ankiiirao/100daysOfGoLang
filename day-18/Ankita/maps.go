/*
=================Maps=================
A map is an unordered collection of key value pairs
The Keys are unique in map while the values may not be.
The map data structure is used for fast lookups, retrieval, and deletion of data
 based on keys. It is one of the most used data structures in computer science.
Maps are reference types.
===================When you should use a map?==========
1.Maps are more versatile than both slices and arrays but this flexibility comes at a cost:
 the extra processing power required for the implementation of a Go map. However, built-in Go
structures are very fast, so do not hesitate to use a Go map when you need to. What you
should remember is that Go maps are very convenient and can store many different kinds
of data, while being both easy to understand and fast to work with.
