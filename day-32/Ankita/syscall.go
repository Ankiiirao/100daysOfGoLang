/*
================Syscall Package==============
# this package provides a large amount of functions and types related to low level operating primitives.
#the syscall package is extensively used by other Go packages, such as os, net, and time, which all provide a portable
interface to the operating system.This means that the syscall package is not the most
portable package in the Go library â€“ that is not its job.

==============Why syscall package?==============
it deals with incompatibilities of system internals as gently as possible and is also well documented.

==================system call======================
a system call is a programmatic way for an application to request something from the kernel of an operating system.
system calls are responsible for accessing and working with most UNIX low-level elements such as
processes, storage devices, printing data, network interfaces, and all kinds of files.
